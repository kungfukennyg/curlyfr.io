My name is _Kenny Goodin_ and I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience across a variety of domains. Some highlights:
- leading a team in [launching a distributed game server network](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723152931/http://mineplex.com/home/m/14896499/article/3881326/page/2) that scaled to over _thirty million registered users_ and _a million monthly active users_, in a partnership with Microsoft in a _$2 billion dollar industry_
- _reverse engineering a game_ with no source code access to build a transparent, robust, and performant _proxy to translate between divergent network protocols_ (both in layer 4 protocol, _TCP <-> UDP_, and layer 7) and _allow previously-unsupported game clients_ to connect to existing server infrastructure _at a fraction of the time and cost_ it would take to build bespoke infrastructure
- building robust backends for [distributed eSports tournaments](https://fuzzable.com/super-league-gamings-nickelodeon/)
- building [intelligent runtime analysis tools](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/agents.html) that _instrument business applications as they run and track untrusted data_ from sources to vulnerable sinks, _flagging active exploit patterns_ and _surfacing vulnerabilities before they're exploited_
- Improving a struggling, slow pipeline of test suites from a runtime of _3-4 hours to ~20 minutes_ by building a Hashicorp stack of _Consul, Vault, and Nomad_. This pipeline orchestrated _tens of thousands of automated tests_ across hundreds of containers to ensure stability across [the JVM's vast ecosystem](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/java-supported-technologies.html), from Java 1.6 up to modernity, and across JVMS (_IBM, Oracle, OpenJDK_) and frameworks (_Tomcat, GlassFish, Grizzly, WebSphere_, to name a few).
- building [secure, fast, and reliable client-facing CLI and GUI applications, secure relays, and distributed backend systems](https://www.strongdm.com/) to provide _seamless, instant, audited_ access management; _zero-trust, granular_ authorization; and fully _encrypted, real-time audit trails_ of queries to/from infrastructure within business networks
